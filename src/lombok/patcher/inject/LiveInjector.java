/**
 * This class allows you to inject a java agent 'on the fly' into your VM. This feature only works on sun-derived VMs, such as the openJDK, sun JVMs,
 * and apple's VMs.
 * 
 * While an agent can be injected in both 1.5 and 1.6 VMs, class reloading is only supported on 1.6 VMs, so if you want to be 1.5 compatible,
 * and want to transform classes, you'll need to ensure you inject the agent before the class you're interested in gets loaded. Otherwise, you can
 * just reload these classes from within the injected agent.
 * <p>
 * As a convenience, you can choose to inject this class (which is also an agent), but as a java agent <b>has</b> to come in a jar file, this only
 * works if this class has been loaded from a jar file on the local file system. If it has indeed been loaded that way, then this class can take care
 * of injecting itself. A common scenario is to distribute your patching application together with {@code lombok.patcher} in a single jar file.
 * That way, you can use the live injector, and your injected agent can then run patchscripts that call into your own code, and all your code's dependencies
 * will be available because they, too, are in this unified jar file.
